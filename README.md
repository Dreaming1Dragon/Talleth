# Talleth

Eventually it's supposed to be a 4-dimensional survival sandbox game, but there is still a long way to go before then.

## Build instructions

I'm using odin so you will need the odin compiler:
https://odin-lang.org/docs/install/

You will need to build from source to get access to the Odin/shared/ directory

you also need to get the FolkLibs library I am working on alongside this:
https://github.com/Dreaming1Dragon/FolkLibs/tree/main

put this into the Odin/shared/ directory

just run make run
